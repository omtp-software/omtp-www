<h3>Intro - wherein I ramble for a moment or three...</h3>
<br />
The workings of the human thought process are an amazingly complex and beautiful thing. We can't really describe or comprehend it's inner workings to any great extent. Two minds can come to the same conclusion by completely different processes; yet those same two can also, by using the same exact process (granted, an extreme coincidence), come to entirely different end results.
<br />
<br />
Don't let my curmudgeonly tone fool you into thinking that I'm railing at or belittling anyone; it's just that I don't think like you other humans, at all. I do love my fellow man, but I swear I lose brain cells everytime someone asks me to explain what I just said. It can be so damn frustrating for me... Deep down I really and truly detest having to take the time to rearrange my thoughts in a manner easy for others to understand; but I do understand the need. The teachers always complained that I didn't show my work; I doubt they would have understood it if I had. I didn't have any of my epiphanies or follow any of my more interesting mental tangents in anything resembling a 'normal' mental state. I think in a tangential manner with everything arranged within a three dimensional construct so I can manipulate the data to test for the best course of action. I know, I know... It sounds convoluted and time-consuming; but it seems to work well for me. I get things done and then store everything I see for use as a future data point in some problem I've set myself to solve.
<br />
<br />
With that said, let's get started and hope things don't 'esplode' all over us...
<br />
<br />
<h3>the Gist - So what exactly is 'a Committee of Lunatics'?</h3>
<br />
Each and every one of us has a 'Committee of Lunatics' within us. These are the facets that make us who we are. The voices you hear when no one else is speaking (and sometimes when they are). A very few of us can actually talk back and forth between each facet, using this information to better ourselves and those around us. After all, deep down they are all just parts of the whole; just another of those glorious things that we humans take for granted.
