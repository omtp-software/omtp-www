<div class="width"><h2>What exactly is <i>a Committee of Lunatics?</i></h2>
<br />
I'm sure that some of you may know how much I truly abhor the general state of 'blogging' these days. I really and truly detest having to take the time to rearrange my thoughts in a manner easy for other to understand. I didn't  have these epiphanies or follow these mental tangents in anything resembling a 'normal' mental state. I don't think like you humans, at all. I swear I lose brain cells everytime someone asks me to explain what I just said. It's just so damn frustrating...
<br /><br />
However, I have also come to the conclusion (quite painfully I might add) that I really can't get around it anymore if I want to be taken seriously these days in my chosen field.
<br /><br />
With that said, let's get started and hope things don't 'esplode' all over us...
<br /><br />
<h3>So what exactly is 'a Committee of Lunatics'?</h3>
<br />
Each and every one of us has a 'Committee of Lunatics' within us. These are the facets that make us who we are. The voices you hear when noone else is speaking (and sometimes when they are). A very few of us can actually talk back and forth between each facet, using this information to better ourselves and those around us. As for proof of this, I give you the following internal conversation to contemplate at your leisure...
<br /><br />
<h4>Prologue</h4>
<br />
<i>Where do I begin...<br />What slippery slope must we traverse...<br />What dark knowledge is safe to share and what is undesirous of same; and while we're thinking about it, do I even know how to tell the difference...</i>
<br /><br />
A long time ago when asked to write a blurb for a unnamed social media site, I wrote simply this:
<br /><br />
<i>Who I am is strangely difficult for me to explain to someone else...<br />
Sometimes, I do not believe that I, myself, know for sure...<br />
A safe description would be the 'odd man out' as it were...<br />
Always striving towards something, yet jaded by the enormity of it all.</i>
<br /><br />
Now, don't get me wrong... I would still be glad to feel justified with merely prattling off some meaningless drivel to explain my presence here; or even content with the thought of being allowed to only 'allude' with hints, and mayhap, a shadowy glimpse of those daemons who drive my 'particular' intellectual thirst that seem so evident to those who may have actually met me.
<br /><br />
<i>But I digress...</i>
<br /><br />
<h4>Onward</h4>
<br />
<i>Now, where was I? Oh, yes... The 'reason' for my presence here.</i>
<br /><br />
<i>&lt;hrm, so many tangents... so little time... Why am I here, anyway?&gt;</i>
<br /><br />
Ah hah! but I have already told you so much about me; what more is there to tell you?
<br /><br />
<ul><li>Should I tell you that, 'This specimen exhibits all the signs of dementia we would expect from an average human.'?</li>
    <li>Would you be concerned if I admitted to any of the deeper whorls and ridges that make up the twisted, scorched plains of my own mental landscape?</li>
    <li>Do you even really care one way or the other about any of my inane babbling up to this point?</li></ul>
<br /><br />
